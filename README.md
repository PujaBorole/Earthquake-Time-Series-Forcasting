# Earthquake-Time-Series-Forcasting
Earthquake Time Series Forecasting using Facebook Prophet, LSTM, and Regression of Lag Values.

# About Project
It is web application to analyse and forecast the magnitude and depth of future earthquake events using Time Series Forecasting. The project includes algorithms such as Facebook Prophet, Regression and Long Short term Memory Network for making forecasts, and Streamlit framework to design the user interface. The mean square error (MSE) is used to estimate the accuracy of each model.
